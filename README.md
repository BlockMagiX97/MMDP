# MMDP
maximaly mininal dynamic protocol
(most work on compile time)
## FEATURES
- basic
- serialization 
- array support (only those defined in MMDP macros)

## TODO
- add ajustable limit to ALL size fields 
- add checks for essentiality
- add not-prefered fields (are sent only if client or server require them)
- add one-of-two fields (only one of the fields is required (useful for compatibility layers))
